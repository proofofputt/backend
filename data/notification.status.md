After reviewing the provided code (`api.py`, `data_manager.py`, `notification_service.py`, and `session_reporter.py`) against the `notifications_outline.md`, here is a detailed analysis of what has and has not been implemented.

### High-Level Summary

The foundational in-app notification system is partially implemented. The core database schema, API endpoints for fetching/managing notifications, and the `notification_service.py` module exist. However, the system is far from complete.

**Key Missing Components:**
*   **Email Notifications:** The `email_utility.py` module does not exist. All calls to `notification_service.send_email_notification` are currently placeholders that only log to the console. **No emails are being sent.**
*   **Scheduled Notifications:** The `scheduler.py` module for handling time-based events (like weekly summaries, reminders, or starting/ending leagues) does not exist. **None of the scheduled notifications are implemented.**
*   **Fundraising Notifications:** The fundraising feature itself is minimal, and the corresponding notifications are almost entirely missing.

### Detailed Implementation Status

#### 1. General Architecture
*   **`notifications` table:** **Implemented.** The schema in `data_manager.py` matches the outline.
*   **`notification_service.py`:** **Implemented.** The service exists with functions for creating notifications and managing them.
*   **`email_utility.py`:** **Not Implemented.**
*   **Core Notification API (`/notifications/...`):** **Implemented.** The GET and POST endpoints for fetching, marking as read, and deleting notifications exist in `api.py`.

#### 2. Account & Security Notifications
*   `Welcome to Proof of Putt!`: **Partially Implemented.** The in-app notification is created upon registration in `api.py`. The email is not sent.
*   `Password Changed`: **Not Implemented.** The `change_password_api` function in `api.py` does not create any notification.
*   `Email Address Updated`: **Not Implemented.** The feature is marked as missing in the outline and there is no corresponding endpoint in `api.py`.
*   `Subscription Upgraded`: **Not Implemented.** The `redeem_coupon_api` function does not create a notification.
*   `Subscription Canceled`: **Not Implemented.** The `/zaprite-webhook` does not handle this event type.
*   `Subscription Payment Failed`: **Not Implemented.** The `/zaprite-webhook` does not handle this event type.

#### 3. Duel Notifications
*   `You've Been Challenged!`: **Implemented.** The `create_duel_api` in `api.py` correctly calls the notification service for an in-app notification. Email is a placeholder.
*   `Duel Accepted`: **Implemented.** The `accept_duel_api` in `api.py` correctly creates an in-app notification for the creator.
*   `Duel Rejected`: **Implemented.** The `reject_duel_api` in `api.py` correctly creates an in-app notification for the creator.
*   `Opponent's Score Submitted`: **Partially Implemented.** The `submit_duel_session` function in `data_manager.py` creates an in-app notification for the opponent. The outline specifies this should also trigger an email, which is not implemented.
*   `Duel Result (Won/Lost/Draw)`: **Implemented.** The `check_and_complete_duel` function in `data_manager.py` correctly creates in-app notifications for both players with the final result.
*   `Duel Expired`: **Not Implemented.** This requires a scheduled task, which does not exist.

#### 4. League Notifications
*   `Invited to League`: **Implemented.** The `invite_to_league_api` in `api.py` correctly creates an in-app notification. Email is a placeholder.
*   `League Joined`: **Implemented.** The `join_league` function in `data_manager.py` correctly creates an in-app notification.
*   `League Session Completed`: **Not Implemented.** The `submit_league_session` function in `data_manager.py` does not create a notification.
*   `Round Results Are In`: **Implemented.** The `_complete_round` function in `data_manager.py` correctly creates in-app notifications for all league members.
*   **All other league notifications (`New Round Starting`, `Final Results`, `Reminder`, `Removed from League`):** **Not Implemented.** These all depend on scheduled tasks or new API endpoints that do not exist.

#### 5. Session & Performance Notifications
*   `Session Report Ready`: **Not Implemented.** The `session_reporter.py` script does not call the notification service after generating a report.
*   `New Personal Best!`: **Not Implemented.** The logic for checking personal bests after a session does not exist.
*   `Weekly Performance Summary`: **Not Implemented.** Requires a scheduled task.
*   `AI Coach Insight`: **Not Implemented.** The `/coach/chat` endpoint does not create a notification when a new analysis is generated.

#### 6. Fundraising Notifications
*   **All fundraising notifications (`Created`, `New Pledge`, `Milestone Reached`, etc.):** **Not Implemented.** The fundraising API endpoints in `api.py` are minimal and do not contain any calls to the notification service. The required logic for checking milestones or handling pledges is also missing.
