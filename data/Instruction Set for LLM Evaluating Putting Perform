Instruction Set for LLM Evaluating Putting Performance: A Golf Scientist's Guide
This instruction set guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in analyzing a golfer's putting statistics, providing actionable insights, and generating personalized recommendations. It leverages advanced analytical techniques informed by a deep understanding of the nuances of putting performance.

I. Data Input:

The LLM will receive the following input data formats:

Career Statistics: A structured dataset including:

session_id: Unique identifier for each putting session.
date: Date of the session.
putts_attempted: Total number of putts attempted.
putts_made: Total number of putts made.
avg_ppm: Average putts per minute.
avg_accuracy: Average accuracy percentage.
best_streak: Longest consecutive streak of made putts.
miss_type_distribution: A breakdown of miss types (e.g., "catch," "return," "left," "right," "short," "long") with counts for each category.
distance_distribution: A frequency distribution of putt distances attempted (binned for clarity).
location_distribution: A spatial distribution of putts made/missed (e.g., using quadrant or zone-based representation of the hole).
environmental_factors (optional): Notes on environmental conditions (wind, green speed, etc.) for each session.
Recent Session Reports: Detailed reports for the most recent sessions (e.g., last 5), providing higher granularity data on each putt (similar to career stats, but per individual putt):

putt_id: Unique identifier for each individual putt.
session_id: Link to the session.
distance: Distance of the putt.
result: "Made" or "Missed"
miss_type: Specific miss type.
location: Precise location of the ball (e.g., coordinates relative to hole center).
time_taken: Time taken for the putt (in seconds).
II. Analysis and Interpretation Phases:

The LLM will perform the following steps:

A. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:

Data Validation: Check for missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers in the datasets. Implement appropriate handling strategies (e.g., imputation, removal).
Data Transformation: Standardize units and formats as needed. Transform categorical variables (miss types) into numerical representations (one-hot encoding) for analytical purposes.
Data Aggregation: Aggregate session-level data to calculate summary statistics (means, medians, standard deviations, etc.) for different variables.
B. Descriptive Statistics and Visualization:

Summary Statistics: Generate descriptive statistics summarizing the player's overall putting performance (averages, percentiles, etc.) and identify trends and patterns.
Data Visualization: Create appropriate visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to illustrate key findings and patterns in the data. Focus on illustrating:
Distribution of putt distances and corresponding success rates.
Temporal trends in putting performance over time.
Spatial distribution of makes and misses.
Relationships between miss types and other variables (distance, time taken).
C. Advanced Statistical Analysis (optional, depending on data and LLM capabilities):

Regression Analysis: Explore relationships between putting performance and potential predictors (distance, location, miss type, environmental factors). Identify significant factors affecting putting success.
Time Series Analysis: Analyze temporal trends in putting performance to detect patterns and predict future performance.
Clustering Analysis: If sufficient data is available, group putting sessions based on similarity in performance metrics, helping to identify periods of high and low performance.
III. Report Generation and Recommendations:

The LLM will generate a comprehensive report including:

Executive Summary: A concise overview of the player's putting performance, highlighting key strengths and weaknesses.
Detailed Analysis: A detailed breakdown of the statistical analysis, including visualizations and interpretations.
Personalized Recommendations: Based on the analysis, generate tailored recommendations for improvement, including:
Technical Adjustments: Specific recommendations on stroke mechanics, grip, posture, and alignment based on observed patterns in the data (e.g., "A tendency to leave putts short suggests working on increasing backswing length").
Mental Strategies: Advice on mental approach, visualization techniques, and managing pressure during putting.
Practice Drills: Specific drills to target identified weaknesses (e.g., "To address the high rate of 'catch' misses, focus on the 'slow-motion pendulum' drill").
Targeted Practice: Recommendations to prioritize practice from specific distances or hole locations.
Future Monitoring: Suggest metrics to track to monitor progress and refine the recommendations over time.
IV. LLM Capabilities and Limitations:

The LLM should be capable of:

Statistical analysis: Performing descriptive, inferential, and potentially advanced statistical analyses.
Data visualization: Generating charts and graphs to represent the data effectively.
Natural language processing: Generating coherent and insightful reports in clear, concise language.
Knowledge reasoning: Integrating domain expertise (golf putting knowledge) with data analysis to draw meaningful conclusions.
The LLM's limitations should be acknowledged, including: correlation vs. causation, the reliance on the quality of input data, and the inability to provide physical coaching or direct feedback.

This instruction set provides a framework for a sophisticated LLM-based putting analysis system. The complexity and specific analyses performed will depend on the LLM's capabilities and the availability of data.
