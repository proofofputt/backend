# Project Brief: Integrating Proof of Putt with ArkadeOS

**To:** Business Development, ArkadeOS

**From:** Proof of Putt

**Date:** August 21, 2025

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: Onboarding the Golf World to Bitcoin

---

### 1. Executive Summary

Proof of Putt is a sophisticated golf training application that uses computer vision to provide players with data-driven feedback on their putting performance. While our immediate goal is to help golfers improve, our long-term vision is to build a vibrant, competitive ecosystem on a Bitcoin standard. We are seeking a strategic partnership with Arkade to leverage the ArkadeOS for user identity and value-for-value monetization, creating a powerful showcase for onboarding a massive, non-technical audience to Bitcoin through a compelling, real-world use case.

### 2. The "Stealth" Bitcoin Approach: Golf First

The key to our strategy is that **Proof of Putt is not a "Bitcoin app"; it is a golf app that uses Bitcoin.** Our target user is a golfer who wants to lower their handicap, not necessarily a pre-existing bitcoiner.

This "stealth" approach is our most significant advantage. We onboard users based on their passion for golf, and introduce them to the power and utility of Bitcoin through features that are impossible or impractical with the legacy financial system. A user's first Lightning transaction won't be an abstract purchase; it will be to pay a 5,000 sat entry fee for a weekend golf league they want to win.

### 3. The Flywheel Effect: Practice, Compete, Earn

Our application creates a powerful and self-reinforcing user engagement loop:

1.  **Practice & Improve:** Users record putting sessions and receive detailed analytics on their performance, giving them tangible proof of their improvement.
2.  **Fuel Competition:** This verified, "proof-of-putt" data becomes the foundation for trusted competition. Users can challenge others to **Duels** or join **Leagues** with confidence that the stats are real.
3.  **Create Value:** This competitive layer naturally creates a demand for value transfer. Entry fees, prize pools, and peer-to-peer challenges become the economic engine of the ecosystem.
4.  **Seamless Monetization (ArkadeOS):** By integrating ArkadeOS, we can offer a seamless, sats-based monetization model that feels native to the competitive experience, avoiding the friction of fiat paywalls or the annoyance of ad-based revenue.

### 4. Proposed ArkadeOS Integration Use Cases

We propose using ArkadeOS as the core infrastructure for identity and payments, replacing our planned integration with traditional auth and Zaprite.

*   **Sovereign Identity:** Allow users to sign in and manage their profile using their Arkade identity, giving them full control over their data.
*   **Subscription Management:** The "Full Subscriber" tier, which unlocks advanced analytics and content, will be managed through Arkade, allowing users to pay in sats.
*   **Pay-to-Play Microtransactions:**
    *   **Duels:** Players pay a small entry fee (e.g., 1,000 sats) to create a duel. The winner automatically receives the pot, minus a small platform fee.
    *   **Leagues:** Players pay a larger entry fee to join a season-long league. ArkadeOS would manage the prize pool escrow and automatically distribute payouts to the top performers based on the final, on-chain results (their putting data).
*   **Verifiable Fundraising:** This is a killer use case.
    *   A player (e.g., a pro or influencer) can launch a fundraiser for a charity (e.g., a junior golf foundation).
    *   Fans can pledge an amount per putt made (e.g., 100 sats/putt).
    *   At the end of the campaign, ArkadeOS can facilitate the automatic collection of pledges and payout to the charity's wallet, creating a transparent and engaging fundraising model.

### 5. The Ask

We believe Proof of Putt can be a flagship application for ArkadeOS, demonstrating its power to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds. We are seeking:

*   **Early access** to the ArkadeOS platform and development tools.
*   **Technical collaboration** to ensure a smooth and successful integration.
*   **A strategic partnership** to co-market Proof of Putt to both the golf and Bitcoin communities, showcasing a real, working product that brings new users into the ecosystem.

We are excited about the possibility of working with Arkade to build the future of competitive, community-funded sport. Thank you for your time and consideration.
