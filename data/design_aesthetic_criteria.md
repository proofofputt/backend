# Design Aesthetic & Visual Language Criteria

This document outlines the core aesthetic principles and visual language for the brand. It serves as a practical guide for designers and developers to ensure consistency, beauty, and emotional resonance across all digital touchpoints, from the website to marketing materials.

## 1. Core Aesthetic Philosophy: "Quiet Confidence"

Our visual identity should communicate **calm, clarity, and intelligence**. It is not loud or aggressive but is assertive in its simplicity and precision. The aesthetic is clean, modern, and human-centric, prioritizing content and usability over ornamentation. Every visual element should feel intentional and purposeful.

## 2. Colorways

Color is our primary tool for setting a mood and guiding the user's eye. We will use a primary palette for the majority of applications, with secondary palettes available for specific contexts like data visualization or special marketing campaigns.

### Primary Colorway: "Deep Tech"

This palette is designed to feel modern, trustworthy, and focused. It's high-contrast and serious, but the "Ink" and "Stone" tones provide a softer alternative to pure black and white, reducing eye strain. The "Electric Teal" is a confident, energetic accent.

*   **Primary/Text (`#121826` - Ink):** A very dark, cool-toned grey. Used for all primary text and dark backgrounds. It's softer than pure black, making it more sophisticated and easier on the eyes.
*   **Background (`#F8F9FA` - Cloud):** A bright, clean off-white. Provides a crisp, airy backdrop for content.
*   **Neutral/Borders (`#E5E7EB` - Stone):** A light, neutral grey for borders, dividers, and disabled states.
*   **Primary Accent (`#00A79D` - Electric Teal):** A vibrant, energetic teal. Used for primary calls-to-action (buttons), active links, and key highlights. It should be used sparingly to maximize its impact.
*   **Secondary Accent (`#4F46E5` - Indigo):** A deep, rich blue. Used for secondary actions, selected states, or to highlight informational icons.

### Secondary Colorway: "Natural Analytics"

For data visualizations (charts, graphs) to ensure clarity and accessibility.

*   **Data Point 1 (`#2E7D32` - Forest Green)**
*   **Data Point 2 (`#F9A825` - Amber)**
*   **Data Point 3 (`#C2185B` - Magenta)**
*   **Data Point 4 (`#0288D1` - Sky Blue)**

## 3. Typography

Typography is the voice of our brand. Our typographic system is built for clarity, hierarchy, and elegance.

*   **Headline Font (Serif):** `Lora` or a similar classic serif font.
    *   **Use:** For all `H1`, `H2`, `H3` headings.
    *   **Rationale:** A serif font adds a touch of gravitas, authority, and traditional readability to headlines, making them feel important and established.
*   **Body & UI Font (Sans-Serif):** `Inter` or `Source Sans Pro`.
    *   **Use:** For all paragraph text, labels, buttons, and navigation.
    *   **Rationale:** A neutral, highly legible sans-serif is essential for user interfaces. It's clean, scalable, and remains clear at small sizes, ensuring a frictionless reading experience.
*   **Typographic Scale:** A modular scale (e.g., 1.25x) will be used to ensure all font sizes are harmonious. (e.g., 12px, 15px, 19px, 24px, 30px).

## 4. Iconography

Icons are a crucial part of our visual shorthand. They must be instantly recognizable and stylistically consistent.

*   **Style:** `Line-art`, single stroke.
*   **Weight:** 2px stroke weight, consistent across all icons.
*   **Details:** Minimalist and symbolic, avoiding excessive detail. They should be clear at a small size (e.g., 16x16px).
*   **Color:** Icons should use the Primary/Text color (`#121826`) by default, and the Primary Accent (`#00A79D`) when indicating an active or selected state.

## 5. Imagery & Photography

Our imagery should feel authentic and human, never like generic stock photography.

*   **Style:** Natural, candid, and professional. Focus on real people in realistic environments. Avoid posed, "business-person-smiling-at-computer" shots.
*   **Lighting:** Bright, natural light.
*   **Color Grading:** A subtle cool-toned filter can be applied to align with the "Deep Tech" colorway, but it should not feel overly stylized.
*   **Abstract Imagery:** When not using photos of people, we can use high-resolution, abstract images of architectural details, textures in nature, or light patterns to convey concepts of precision, structure, and flow.

## 6. Layout, Spacing & Animation

*   **Grid System:** All layouts will be built on an 8pt grid system. All spacing and component sizes will be a multiple of 8 (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.). This ensures mathematical harmony and visual consistency across all screens.
*   **Whitespace:** Generous whitespace is a key feature of our aesthetic. It will be used to group related items, create focus on key content, and give the design a clean, uncluttered, and premium feel.
*   **Animation Style:** Animations and micro-interactions should be **subtle and physics-based**. They should feel natural, not robotic.
    *   **Duration:** 200-300ms is ideal for most UI transitions.
    *   **Easing:** Use "ease-out" curves, where the animation starts fast and slows down at the end. This feels more responsive and polished than linear motion.
    *   **Purpose:** Animation should be used to provide feedback (a button was clicked), guide focus (a new element appears), or explain a state change (an item is deleted from a list).
