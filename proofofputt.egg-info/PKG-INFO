# Proof of Putt

This project is a comprehensive putt tracking system that uses computer vision to analyze golf putts, a Python backend with a Flask API to manage data, and a React front-end for user interaction.

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up both the Python backend and the React frontend.

### Prerequisites

-   [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
-   A PostgreSQL database (e.g., via [Neon](https://neon.tech/) or a local installation).

---

## Backend Setup (Python / Flask)

1.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies in Editable Mode:**
    This project uses a `pyproject.toml` file to manage dependencies and define command-line scripts. Installing in "editable" mode (`-e`) links the package to your source files, so any changes you make are immediately reflected.
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    *Note: This replaces the need for `pip install -r requirements.txt`.*

3.  **Configure the Database:**
    Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point to your PostgreSQL database. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in the root directory or exporting it in your shell.
    ```
    # Example for .env file
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host/dbname"
    ```

4.  **Run Backend Scripts:**
    After installation, you can use the following commands from your terminal:
    - **Run the API Server:** `proofofputt-api`
    - **Manage Players:** `proofofputt-manage list`
    - **Run the Putt Tracker:** `proofofputt-tracker --camera_index 0`

    The API server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Frontend Setup (React / Vite)

1.  **Create the React project:**
    From the root `proofofputt` directory, run the following command to create a `webapp` subdirectory for the frontend code.
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest webapp -- --template react
    ```
    **Important:** The command will ask for confirmation to install `create-vite`. Type `y` and press Enter to proceed.

2.  **Navigate into the webapp directory:**
    ```bash
    cd webapp
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The React development server will start, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Troubleshooting

### `command not found: proofofputt-manage` (or other scripts)

If you see an error like `zsh: command not found: proofofputt-manage` after activating your virtual environment, it means the command-line scripts were not installed correctly.

**Solution:**

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is active (`source venv/bin/activate`).
2.  Re-run the editable installation command from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    This command creates the necessary script files (like `proofofputt-manage`) inside your virtual environment's `bin` directory.

3.  If the command still fails, you can run the script directly as a Python module:
    ```bash
    python manage_players.py list
    ```
