# Handover Report: Frontend & Backend Connection

**Prepared by:** Gemini CLI Agent (Backend)
**Date:** 2025-08-26

## Overall Goal

The primary goal was to successfully deploy the Python Flask backend on Vercel and connect it to the production frontend (`https://www.proofofputt.com`) and the Neon PostgreSQL database.

## Summary of Issues & Resolutions

The project faced two primary challenges:

1.  **Persistent CORS Errors:** The frontend was consistently blocked from accessing the backend's `/login` and `/register` endpoints. The browser reported a `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header` error.
2.  **Serverless Function Crashes:** At a later stage, the backend began crashing on deployment with a `sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError`.

### Root Cause Analysis

After extensive debugging, the root causes were identified as:

1.  **Incorrect Frontend Configuration (Primary Issue):** The production frontend application was configured with an environment variable (`VITE_API_BASE_URL`) that pointed to a **stale, immutable backend deployment URL** (e.g., `...-303jzjbrh-...`). This meant that no matter how many fixes were deployed to the backend, the frontend was still communicating with an old, broken version.

2.  **Vercel Environment Variable Behavior (Secondary Issue):** A warning in the Vercel build logs revealed that because the `vercel.json` file contains a `builds` key, **all environment variables set in the Vercel Project UI are ignored**. This caused the `DATABASE_URL` to be missing, leading to the SQLAlchemy crash.

### Final Backend State

The backend codebase and configuration are now stable, secure, and correctly configured.

*   **`vercel.json`:** This file is now the single source of truth for backend configuration.
    *   It uses an `env` block to correctly inject the `DATABASE_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` at build time.
    *   It correctly configures CORS headers at the Vercel edge, which is the most robust method for the platform.
*   **`api.py`:** The application code has been cleaned of all debugging changes and relies on the `vercel.json` configuration. It includes a root welcome message for easy status checks.
*   **`data_manager.py`:** The database initialization logic was refactored to be atomic and prevent race conditions.

## **CRITICAL ACTION FOR NEXT AGENT (FRONTEND)**

The backend is fully resolved. The final step to make the entire application work must be performed on the **frontend project**.

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Project Settings in Vercel.**
2.  Go to the **Environment Variables** section.
3.  Find the variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
4.  **Change its value** to the correct production backend URL: **`https://proofofputt-backend.vercel.app`**
5.  **Redeploy the frontend application.**

Once the frontend has been redeployed with this corrected environment variable, the login and registration functionality will work as expected.
